## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke freshness and the Antarctic theme. This should draw a connection with water without being overly literal, because food is still the focus of the user's attention.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9500) to highlight key actions and draw user attention.
- Secondary color: A complementary green (#4CAF50) to add visual interest and represent fresh ingredients.
- Font Pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text. A balance between sophistication and easy reading is sought.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent food categories and actions.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout for easy navigation and order placement.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on user interactions, such as adding items to the cart.
